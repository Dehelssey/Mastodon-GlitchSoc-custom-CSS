# Mastodon-GlitchSoc-custom-CSS
rework of my previous Mastodon custom template. Now based on GlitchSoc (not gonna look well on vanilla Mastodon)


This custom theme is a Dark with vivid green accent theme.
Buttons on hovers are animated rainbows cause it's cool

@mentions and #hastags are displayed differently than classic urls so toots are more readable
